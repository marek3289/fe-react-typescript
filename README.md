# Codemachine: Front End assessment

Create an application displaying GitHub users. Use
[GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) as your data source.

## Your task

### Views

#### Home page

- Display a list of GitHub users. One _user_ should have an avatar, GitHub
  username (example: _@octocat_), and a button linking to their profile in your
  app (the _User details page_).
- Show a loading spinner before the users are fetched.
- Implement infinite scroll (fetch more users automatically after scrolling
  down).

#### User details page

- This view should contain information about the chosen user:
  - GitHub username
  - Name
  - Avatar
  - Link do their profile on GitHub
  - How many public repositories they have
- A _Back_ button, which, when clicked, should redirect the user to the home
  page.
- It should work after refreshing the page.

### Tips

As a part of the review we will:

- look at the tests setup,
- look at the design of the app (it doesn't have to be perfect but we need a person that has an eye for details),
- read your commit history,
- consider the size of the output (you should use only essential auxiliary
  libraries and leverage modern browser APIs).

Bonus points for:

- build optimizations,
- performant animations,
- any commits that improve the developer experience and codebase quality (like
  introducing a TypeScript linter with a prepush script)

Other:

- Fix TypeScript errors.
- If you happen to exhaust the limit of available API calls, you can increase it
  by using a [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
  For detailed instruction, see the
  [Rate limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) chapter of
  GitHub API documentation.

## Technology

This repository already includes React, Redux, CSS modules and TypeScript. You
are free to choose whatever auxiliary libraries you like â€” we recommend
`redux-saga` for side effects as we use it ourselves.

## Submitting your work

To submit your work you can either put the repository on a _private_ GitHub
repository and invite the person at Codemachine you're in contact with as a
collaborator, or alternatively zip the entire repository and send it via email.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server in development mode
npm run start

# Build for production
npm run build
```
